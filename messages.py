start = "Welcome to the Lightning picture bot by @f321x ! \n\nThis bot supports DALLE3 (censored) and Stable Diffusion (" \
        "uncensored). \n\nI charge 1000 satoshi to pay for the picture generation and the server this bot is running on. " \

todo = "You can now type in the image description you want to pass to the AI:"

help = "Type in a command for the AI like the examples you can find in the group chat, then pay the " \
       "Lightning invoice with a Lightning enabled Bitcoin wallet like Blixt Wallet or Phoenix Wallet (easy), " \
       "then the Bot will send you the generated Pictures after some time (minutes). You can set the seed for Stable " \
       "Diffusion by appending /yourseed to the end of the prompt. The Seed has to be a number and max 9 " \

       "problems contact me on Telegram @f321x or read the source code of this Bot on github to understand how it " \

problem = "If you encounter any problem please contact @f321x on TG and i will refund or help you. \n\nIf you paid but " \

violation = "Your message violated the OpenAI /terms so DALLE didn't return pictures. Please try not to violate the " \
            "terms otherwise the account serving this bot will probably get banned. DALLE doesn't like politics, " \

            "uncensored image generation use Stable Diffusion for the weird stuff :D Thanks! \n\nIf this message is " \
            "unreasonable and shows up repeatedly the DALLE API could also have some problems currently, in this case " \
            "you should wait some hours and try again later or use Stable Diffusion instead. "
