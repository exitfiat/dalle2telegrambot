A Telegram and Nostr bot for AI Image generation with Bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network

Currently supports Stable Diffusion, DALLE 2 and a Midjourney like diffusion model.

This is my first bigger project so be careful using it and check the code if you plan to utilize it.

Dependencies:
* Pillow
* python-telegram-bot (--pre)
* qrcode
* requests
* python-dotenv
* jeffthibault/python-nostr

The dalle2.py file is a modified version of the ezzcodeezzlife/dalle2-in-python module

Functions:
* multiple AIs (DALLE2 and Stable Diffusion)
* payments and refunding with LNbits
* logging
* multiple chat protocols (Nostr and Telegram)

Tested with Phoenix Wallet (https://phoenix.acinq.co/)
